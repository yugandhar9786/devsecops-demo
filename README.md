## Game Logic

The game implements the following rules:

1. X goes first, followed by O
2. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins
3. If all 9 squares are filled and no player has 3 marks in a row, the game is a draw
4. Winning combinations are highlighted
5. Game statistics are tracked and displayed
